      <h3>Childhood</h3>
        <p>I grew up with a normal amount of friends (3). I went to almost all elementary schools besides Spring Hill. I hated all my school mates because they took my food. I was okay in my classes (Are B's and C's good?). My favorite thing growing up was to watch anime. Anime shaped me into the random invisable girl I am right now. I hated the world but still smiled every day. I was bullied growing up just over my weight. I was over-weight about 20 pound and it showed on my stomach. My child was scaried but still full of some sunlight.</p>
        <h3>Now</h3>
        <p>I am a junior in school who is afraid to make a B as a final grade due to my mom. Im in a amazing relationship with a guy who is in the same major I want to be in college: Music Education. I have my whole plan for college ready and set. I want to own my own business as a vocal music teacher. I have amazing friends who all love ANIME! All of them are artistic in some way. We are weird in our own way. I love them due to them making my day brighter everyday.</p>
